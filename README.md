## homebrew-vmfloaty: install vmfloaty as a standalone app

### How do I use this?

```bash
mckern@flexo ~ $ brew tap mckern/vmfloaty
==> Tapping mckern/vmfloaty
< blah blah blah>
mckern@flexo floaty (git:master) $ brew install vmfloaty
```

### Why would I use this?

Ruby is trash for standalone applications, but Homebrew is pretty solid at wrapping up applications with funky dependencies or wonky runtimes. Snip-snip-snip, Bob's your uncle, and here's a Homebrew tap for your troubles!

### Support & contribution?

In the spirit of Jordan Sissel (a hero to admins and operations people everywhere), if homebrew-vmfloaty isn't helping you float some VMs, then there is a bug in homebrew-vmfloaty. Please open an issue or submit a pull request if something doesn't work.
